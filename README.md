## Rules
- **Components**: The Simon game typically consists of a circular device with four colored buttons, each producing a distinct sound. The colors are usually red, green, blue, and yellow. The game also has an internal speaker for sound playback
- **Sequence Presentation**: The game starts with a sequence of colors or sounds that is played by the device. This initial sequence is usually short, typically one or two steps long
- **Player's Turn**: After the device plays the sequence, the player's turn begins. The player must repeat the sequence of colors or sounds in the exact order they were presented. The player uses the colored buttons to reproduce the sequence
- **Increasing Difficulty**: For each successful turn, the game adds one more step to the sequence, making it progressively longer and more challenging. The player must remember and accurately replicate the entire sequence from the beginning of the game
- **Mistake Penalty**: If the player makes a mistake and fails to replicate the correct sequence, the game ends, and the player's score is recorded. In some versions of the game, there might be multiple rounds, and the player's final score is based on the highest sequence completed successfully
- **Speed and Accuracy**: As the game progresses, the speed at which the sequence is presented and the time given to the player for replication might decrease, adding to the difficulty of the game
- **Winning the Game**: The goal of Simon is to achieve the highest score possible by accurately repeating the increasingly longer sequences. There is no official "winning" the game as it's designed to test and challenge the player's memory and attention span.
